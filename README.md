   2. Login: Users can log in with their registered username and password.
   3. Password Change: Provides the option to change the password after verifying the old password.
   4. File Handling: Utilizes file I/O to store and retrieve user information.
      
# CODE STRUCTURE
 The program consists of a single C++ source file (security_system.cpp) with the following key components:
 1. User Interface: Displays a menu with options for registration, login, password change, and program termination.
 2. Switch Case: Uses a switch statement to handle user choices and execute corresponding actions.
 3. File Handling: Manages user data using file I/O operations for registration, login, and password change.
